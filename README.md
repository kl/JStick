__JStick__

JStick is a Java application for simulation mouse movements and mouse presses using a gamepad or joystick.

__Usage__

Plug in your controller and run JStick.java. You should now be able to move the mouse with the left analog stick and
click with the shoulder buttons.

__Dependencies__

* jinput (http://java.net/projects/jinput)

__Notes__

This is a very early version of JStick. It does not currently have GUI or a way to configure options,
but those will be added soon. Please make a pull request if you want to help out. :)
